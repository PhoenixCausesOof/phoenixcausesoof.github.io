For those not aware (literally everyone), I have written a written a small post-installation guide for Fedora Linux. I have seen my fair share of people just not knowing what to do (yours truly being one of them) and I felt like I could contribute (even if very little) to Fedora's community.  
The guide is in fact, quite biased. A lot of the instructions derive from my personal experience with the software ecosystem as a whole (that including the browser, DE, or OS, in this case.). That said, I believe it would prove quite useful if someone were to actually use it.

Anyway, there's not much else to say so I'll just drop the link below. Enjoy.
